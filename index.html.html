    <h3 class="dso">The D.S.O stands for the Dilogical Scientific Orginisation It is where we study about Dile he is a dooline. Dile is a great great grandpa now he's been around for so long now you might be wondering why we research him. Well we are actully inside him right now but you won't realise he's the fattest creature in the galaxy. But we don't notice because his skin is Ω to the power of  Ω million million miles away or even more but there is something you can try to see him if you look outside at night only one day of the year you can see a pixal of it if you took a picture with a telescope. The D.S.O calculates Diles details and are the head of Dile and keep us safe from him eating us. Scientists have figured out that life could be forming on Dile's skin and it could be happaning now and if the population increases we will see more peach in the sky!</h3>
